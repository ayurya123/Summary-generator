# Summary-generator
A Summary Generator using Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a tool designed to automatically generate concise and coherent summaries of longer texts or documents. Leveraging advanced NLP techniques and algorithms, such as text summarization algorithms, machine learning models, and neural networks, the summary generator can extract key information from a given text and condense it into a shorter form while preserving the main ideas and important details.
